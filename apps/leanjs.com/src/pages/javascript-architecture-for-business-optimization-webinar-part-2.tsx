              Many of the products and tools that support businesses nowadays
              rely heavily on JavaScript. In our previous webinar, we were
              discussing different software, architectures, and processes to
              optimize the JavaScript of our organizations, exploring the
              tension between centralizing and decentralizing.
            </P>
            <P>
              This time weâ€™ll discuss the tension between concreteness and
              abstraction and how it can affect the architecture of Web-based
              software. Many problems in the acthitecture arise from a bad
              understanding of where we should be in the different levels of
              abstraction.
            </P>
            <P>
              To be more concrete, we'll explore these ideas in the space of
              JAMstack. The JAMstack ecosystem is growing rapidly. There are a
              variaty of frameworks, tools, and services that we can use to
              optimize products in varies ways.

              <Li>
                Your company has fewer developers now and it can't afford
                reducing the velocity of the product team/s.
              </Li>
              <Li>
                You want to find an internal and cost-effective solution to
                launch new products faster.
              </Li>
              <Li>
                Your company had to lay off the CTO, CIO, Solution Architect or
                any tech decision-maker, and now it needs to make critical
                decisions about Web-based system architectures.
