            <P>
              Aside from when you sign up to a training, ReactGraphQL.Academy is
              collecting your email through a newsletter sign-up form.{' '}

            <H2>

              Why is it collected?
            </H2>
            <P>
              Apart from sending you details about any purchases with us, your

            <P>
              Using your email as the primary way of setting up the account
              means that, whatever happens - issues with your account, important

            </P>
            <P>
              Another key reason for collecting your email is to confirm your

              attending. These communications will not be unsolicited and only
              initiated if you have indicated you’d like to receive them. These

              training/event/service.{' '}
            </P>
            <P>
              For example, we hold many training events at third party venues

              will be sent to them to create a vistors list.
