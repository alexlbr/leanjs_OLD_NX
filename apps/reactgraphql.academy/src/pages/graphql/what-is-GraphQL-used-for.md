Some say that [data is the new oil](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2017/05/06/the-worlds-most-valuable-resource-is-no-longer-oil-but-data), but it isn’t enough to just have a vast amount of data - you also need to know how to use it efficiently. GraphQL is how you use data better. If you’re not clued up on GraphQL, the term could seem a little daunting. Today, we’re going to answer the question "What is GraphQL?" and show you what GraphQL is used for and why you should use it.

## What is GraphQL? <a name="what-is-graphql"></a>

GraphQL is a syntax that describes how to ask a server for data. It’s used to send data requests to an API and load only that data for a client. With GraphQL, your apps get to decide what data they need and receive only that. GraphQL lets you ask for data in an organised way, which means you can build apps that are quick and efficient, even when network connectivity is poor. It’s a favoured tool among forward-thinking developers.

## How does GraphQL work? <a name="how-does-graphql-work"></a>

Simply put, GraphQL is a query language for your API. It’s an efficient query language because it allows you to control the data coming to your app from the server, making your apps more stable and faster as a result.

Traditionally, you would have had to make REST API requests to get the data you need. This is a cumbersome way to request data because it requires loading from multiple URLs. For every data type you need to know about, you’ll have to make a separate request. It’s up to the client (app) to distil that information, which is a slow process.

### GraphQL makes apps quicker <a name="graphql-makes-apps-quicker"></a>

GraphQL takes the hassle out of making data requests, speeding up your apps in the process. It allows you to pull all the information you need in a single request. It does this by acting as a buffer between the server and the client.

To demonstrate what I mean, let’s think about a music app. In the app, you have a list of songs and artists. These are two separate data types, each with hundreds or thousands of entries in them. It may sound simple, but when you make a data request your app could have to sift through tonnes of data. That’s slow.

But that’s how a traditional REST API works. You have to make two separate requests between the client and the server to receive both song and artist. Your app then has to distil two separate lists to get the correct information.

GraphQL makes this way simpler. It stays between the client and the server at all times. It receives requests from the client, interprets these and sends a request onto the server. When it receives the data from the server, it changes the data output into a format the client wants and needs.

This modern syntax is used for making efficient data requests to servers. Its greatest feature is the fact that it allows you to only ask for the data you need. Because you get to decide how much data is returned from the server, your app can run more efficiently than with other query languages.

There are myriad companies using GraphQL right now. Some have been using it since 2012, like Facebook. Other users include GitHub, PayPal, Twitter, Sky and Hudl. All are making their apps more efficient by refining their data use.
