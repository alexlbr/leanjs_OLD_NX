                During this workshop we will build a working ReasonReact app
                with GraphQL backend.
              </Li>
              <Li>
                We will also add JavaScript npm packages and interop between
                them and our Reason React app.
              </Li>
              <Li>
                For final touch we will discuss how to embed our ReasonReact app
                as part of bigger existing React application.
