# Principles

Lean UI is based on set of principles. Understanding these principles will help you be more productive with Lean UI

- **Style Props**. Style props is a way to style components by passing props to it. Style props are mapped to CSS properties.
- **Composition**. Every Lean UI component is composed with a component primitive called `Box`. We encourage to to break down the UI into smaller components that can be composed easily.
- **Theming**. The theme object is where we define the design tokens. Theming with Lean UI is based on the [Theme Specification](https://theme-ui.com/theme-spec)
- **Minimal API surface Area**. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4anAwXYqLG8
