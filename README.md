# ReactJS Academy website

ReactJS Academy has been built with Gatsby. Gatsby is a static site generator for React and is a great solution if you are building a content heavy site, you can read more about Gatsby in the [official docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/) and you can read more about [our experiences using Gatsby.](https://medium.com/leanjs/the-great-and-not-so-great-gatsbyjs-788b5fb34e77) :sunglasses:

## Install

Cone this repo to your local machine and run

```sh
npm install
```

Make sure that you have the Gatsby CLI program installed:

```sh
npm install --global gatsby-cli
```

### We have several scripts in place:

- To run the site, user `npm run develop`
- To run the tests use `npm run test` or `npm run testw` for watch mode
- To generate a code coverage report use `npm run coverage`
- To run storybook to visually see the components, use `npm run storybook`

There are a few other scripts in the package.json that are used for formatting via [prettier](https://prettier.io/) and to spin up production builds of the site, please refer to the [gatsby docs](https://v1.gatsbyjs.org/) for further reading on the later.

## Our Testing

We use [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for testing. As the site is content heavy, we use snapshot tests for parts with little or no logic and write full unit and integration tests for mission critical parts such as `src/components/payment/payment.test.js`


## Our Deploy and Hosting

We use [Google's firebase platform](https://firebase.google.com/) for hosting the site. There is a generous free layer and so the site does not cost anything to host. This also allows for the rapid addition of features that you need a backend for (such as contact forms etc), for which we use [cloud functions](https://firebase.google.com/products/functions/). We also use the [cloud storage](https://firebase.google.com/products/storage/), which is a CDN, to keep the weight of images off the server and maintain a rapid build time.

### Test Peril integration
